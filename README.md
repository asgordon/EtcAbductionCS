# EtcAbductionCS

## An implementation of Etcetera Abduction in C#

This software is an implementation of Etcetera Abduction in C#, based on the reference implementation in Python. Given a knowledge base of first-order definite clauses and a set of observables, this software identifies the most probable set of assumptions that logically entails the observations, assuming the conditional independence of each assumption. 

For more information, see the reference implementation of Etcetera Abduction in Python: https://github.com/asgordon/EtcAbductionPy
